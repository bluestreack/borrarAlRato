            Nightmare
            Now your nightmare comes to life

            Dragged you down below, down to the devil's show
            To be his guest forever (peace of mind is less than never)
            Hate to twist your mind, but God ain't on your side
            An old acquaintance severed (burn the world your last endeavor)
            Flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air
            'Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal (steal)
            So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head
            You're now a slave until the end of time here
            Nothing stops the madness turning
            Haunting, yearning, pull the trigger

            You should've known the price of evil
            And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
            Ooh, it's your fuckin' nightmare
            While your nightmare comes to life

            Can't wake up in sweat, 'cause it ain't over yet
            Still dancin' with your demons (victim of your own creation)
            Beyond the will to fight, where all that's wrong is right
            Where hate don't need a reason (loathing self-assassination)
            You've been lied to just to rape you of your sight
            And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel (feel)
            So sedated as they medicate your brain
            And while you slowly go insane they tell you
            Given with the best intentions
            Help you with your complications

            You should've known the price of evil
            And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
            No one to call, everybody to fear
            Your tragic fate is lookin' so clear, yeah
            Ooh, it's your fuckin' nightmare
            Ha, ha, ha, ha

            Fight (fight), not to fail (fail), not to fall (fall)
            Or you'll end up like the others
            Die (die), die again (die), drenched in sin (sin)
            With no respect for another
            Oh

            Down (down), feel the fire (fire), feel the hate (hate)
            Your pain is what we desire
            Lost (lost), hit the wall (wall), watch you crawl (crawl)
            Such a replaceable liar

            And I know you hear their voices (calling from above)
            And I know they may seem real (these signals of love)
            But our life's made up of choices (some without appeal)
            They took for granted your soul
            And it's ours now to steal
            As your nightmare comes to life

            You should've known the price of evil
            And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
            No one to call, everybody to fear
            Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
            Ooh, it's your fuckin' nightmare
